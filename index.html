        <p>"In<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Vasistha" target="_blank"> Yoga Vasistha </a>  there is a conversation between Bhagwan Ram and his Guru Vasistha where Ram once toured his kingdom and found his whole kingdom was flourished with diseases when he goes and tells this to his guru his guru replies by saying that  disease begins in mind this happens due to negative thoughts which lead to imbalance in the mental sheath(Manamaya Kosha) this leads to imbalance in the vital energy sheath(Pranamaya Kosha) due to which there is imbalance of energy in the whole body which manifests itself into the Anamaya Kosha or the gross body  in the form of disease so The Yogic system was designed in a way to take all this into account and help people to have a good holistic health"</p>

        <br>
        <p>"In present world through the help of science we know that we require:-"</p>

        
        <br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>streches for a flexible body
        
            </li>
            <li>aerobic exercises for muscle strength</li>
            <li>Cardiovascular activities for heart </li>
            <li>Balancing posture  for old age</li>
            <li>Inverted postures for nourishing the brain</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So, it is very amazing to know that the yogic scriptures of Hatha yoga had postures which were the perfect mix of all of this. Even the diseases like Hyperthyroidism can be cured by doing asanas like sarvangasana which would squeeze the thyroid gland after that matsyendra asana which will stretch the organ and pranayama which would vibrate the organ and doing it regularly would result torning up of the organ on its own and the vibration from pranayama will do the servicing .Also students who practice yoga find it very easy to learn thing ,they have a very good memory but doing only Hatha yoga is not enough.Hatha<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatha_Yoga_Pradipika" target="_blank"> Yoga Pradipika</a> says physical postures are beneficial but breathing mindfully is 20  times more beneficial and meditation is 20 times more beneficial then breathing after all if you mind is not in the correct direction then it undo the things that you do .</p>
